    "subtitle": "Scheme X: India's Strategic Leap in Global Compliance",
    "intro": "India is raising the bar for product safety and quality through Scheme X, a major initiative under the BIS Conformity Assessment Regulations, 2018, refined by the 2022 Amendment. Far from being a routine compliance measure, Scheme X is a forward-looking conformity assessment framework that aligns domestic and imported products with international safety and technical standards. The focus is especially sharp on machinery and electrical equipment, including rotary electrical machines, pumps, compressors, transformers, switchgear, and cranes. For such products, obtaining a BIS certificate is now mandatory, signifying compliance with some of the most stringent standards globally.",
    "exemptionsTitle": "Exemptions under scheme X of BIS certification",
    "exemptionsContent": "Scheme X also casts a specialized lens on construction machinery, especially those falling under the CMVR Rules, 1989. In partnership with the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH), a tailor-made conformity protocol has been introduced for these heavy-duty machines. This ensures that even the most robust equipment complies with exceptional safety and operational standards, further strengthening India's regulatory framework. By implementing Scheme X in sectors that impact public safety and infrastructure, the Indian BIS is reinforcing its mission to elevate domestic and imported product reliability.",
    "regulationTitle": "Understanding the Omnibus Technical Regulation or Scheme X Certification Under Indian BIS.",
    "regulationParagraph1": "The Omnibus Technical Regulation, officially titled \"Machinery and Electrical Equipment Safety (Omnibus Technical Regulation) Order, 2024\", was notified by the Ministry of Heavy Industries on August 28, 2024. Set to be enforced from August 28, 2025, this regulation mandates compliance with Scheme X certification under the Indian BIS framework for a wide range of machinery and electrical equipment manufactured or imported in India. The date of implementation was further extended to 1st September 2026.",
    "regulationParagraph2": "The Omnibus Technical Regulation is a transformative step toward enhancing industrial safety and standardization. It applies to a wide array of machinery and electrical equipment, including assemblies, sub-assemblies, and components. From pumps and compressors to centrifuges, transformers, and switchgear, all covered products must obtain BIS certification under Scheme X to be legally sold in India from 1st September 2026.",
    "regulationParagraph3": "However, there are a few exceptions. Products already governed under other orders issued via Section 16 of the Bureau of Indian Standards Act, 2016 are excluded. Additionally, goods manufactured specifically for export and construction equipment governed by the CMVR Rules, 1989 under MoRTH (Ministry of Road Transport and Highways), are also exempt.",
    "regulationParagraph4": "Under Scheme X certification, manufacturers can obtain either a BIS licence or a Certificate of Conformity (CoC) from the Bureau of Indian Standards. This allows the usage of the BIS standard mark, which is a strong symbol of trust and quality assurance. The BIS licence under this scheme confirms that products meet all applicable technical and safety standards.",
    "regulationParagraph5": "The focus of the Indian BIS through this regulation is to ensure that only safe, compliant, and high-performance machinery reaches end users. By mandating BIS certification, the government ensures a uniform benchmark for product safety.",
    "regulationParagraph6": "The Omnibus Technical Regulation is not just a policy reform—it's a catalyst for elevating the Indian manufacturing landscape. It empowers local manufacturers to meet global standards while strengthening the domestic compliance ecosystem. With Scheme X certification, India is moving towards a future where product quality, safety, and international compatibility are seamlessly aligned."

    "mainTitle": "Difference Between Scheme X and ISI Mark: Understanding Indian BIS Certification Systems",
    "overviewTitle": "Overview",
    "overviewContent": "When it comes to product safety and quality assurance in India, two key terms often surface: Scheme X and the ISI mark. Both fall under the umbrella of the Indian BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards), yet they serve different roles in the BIS certification ecosystem. Understanding the distinction is essential for manufacturers, importers, and businesses seeking a BIS certificate or BIS licence.",
    "isiMarkTitle": "About ISI mark",
    "isiMarkContent": "The ISI mark is a part of the BIS certification process for products conforming to specific Indian Standards. Products bearing the ISI mark signify consistent compliance with safety, performance, and quality benchmarks as specified in the relevant Indian standard. The ISI mark is mandatory for various everyday consumer goods such as electrical appliances, pressure cookers, helmets, and more.",
    "schemeXTitle": "About Scheme X Certification",
    "schemeXContent": "On the other hand, Scheme X is a more recent and advanced conformity assessment framework introduced under the BIS Conformity Assessment Regulations, 2018. Scheme X is designed specifically for machinery, industrial products, and complex electrical equipment that require rigorous technical scrutiny. Products certified under Scheme X must obtain a BIS certificate or BIS license, confirming conformity with high-level safety and technical specifications. This scheme offers both the BIS licence and the Certificate of Conformity (CoC), making it ideal for imported products as well.",
    "conclusionTitle": "Conclusion",
    "conclusionContent": "While the ISI mark focuses on simple, standardized consumer goods, Scheme X is tailored for specialized, often industrial-grade items where detailed testing, factory inspections, and batch verification are necessary. Both systems are managed by the Indian BIS, but the procedures, product categories, and depth of assessment differ significantly.",
