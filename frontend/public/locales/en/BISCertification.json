    "subHeading1": "BIS Certification in India: Ensuring Quality with ISI Mark",
    "description1": "BIS Certification in India is a mandatory quality standard issued by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), the national standardization body under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs. A BIS certificate confirms that a product complies with Indian safety, quality, and performance benchmarks. Products that meet these standards are granted the ISI mark, a symbol of trust and reliability for Indian consumers.

Without this mark, the sale or import of such goods is prohibited in India. The BIS certification process involves product testing in BIS-recognized laboratories, factory audits, and continued surveillance after the license is granted. Whether you're an Indian manufacturer or a foreign company aiming to enter the Indian market, obtaining the Indian BIS license is critical for compliance and market access. With the growing emphasis on consumer safety and product quality, the BIS certificate has become a key requirement across industries. By obtaining BIS certificate or BIS licence, businesses not only ensure legal compliance but also gain a competitive advantage in the Indian marketplace.",
    "subHeading2": "BIS Certification Scheme",
    "description2": "The BIS certification scheme is a regulatory framework by the Indian BIS to ensure products meet quality and safety benchmarks as per Indian standards.
