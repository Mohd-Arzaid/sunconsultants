    "title": "Introduction to BIS Certification in India for Indian Manufacturers",
    "paragraph1": "India's manufacturing ecosystem is undergoing a dynamic transformation, and with the government's push for 'Make in India,' ensuring product quality and compliance has never been more vital. One of the most crucial steps for any domestic manufacturer aiming to thrive in the Indian market is obtaining the BIS certification.",
    "paragraph2": "The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is the national body responsible for establishing and maintaining product quality standards. The BIS certificate ensures that a product meets specific Indian standards and is safe, reliable, and of good quality.",
    "paragraph3": "For domestic manufacturers, BIS certification is not merely a legal requirement; it's a mark of trust. The BIS license signals compliance, opens access to wider markets, and enhances brand credibility. With the widespread emphasis on quality assurance and customer safety, the Indian BIS system has emerged as a regulatory backbone for industrial and consumer product sectors alike.",
    "paragraph4": "The BIS certification also includes the ISI mark, a key indicator that a product conforms to the Indian Standards Institute's specifications. ISI mark products are often mandatory in sectors such as electronics, cement, steel, automotive components, and household goods. For manufacturers, acquiring the ISI mark via BIS registration can be the difference between market success and regulatory setbacks."
  },
  "overview": {
    "title": "What is the ISI Mark?",
    "description": "The ISI mark is the hallmark of quality and safety for products manufactured and sold in India. Short for the Indian Standards Institute, the ISI mark signifies that a product conforms to the Indian standard (IS) specified by BIS. This mark ensures consumers that the product has been tested and certified by a BIS license and complies with national safety, performance, and reliability standards.",
    "commonProducts": {
      "title": "Common ISI mark products include:",
      "list": [
        "Electrical appliances like electric irons, room heaters, and water geysers",

        "Steel products",
        "Pressure cookers",
        "Automotive components, etc."
      ]
    },
    "mandatoryNote": "In many cases, having the ISI mark is mandatory under Indian law. Products falling under the Compulsory Certification Scheme must not be sold in India without this certification.",
    "bisLicense": {
      "title": "What is a BIS License?",
      "description1": "A BIS license is the formal authorization issued by the Bureau of Indian Standards that allows a manufacturer to use the ISI mark on their product. The license certifies that the product, manufacturing process, and facilities have all met BIS's rigorous quality control criteria.",
      "description2": "To obtain a BIS license, a manufacturer must go through the BIS registration process, which includes submitting documentation, product testing, factory inspections, and ongoing surveillance.",
      "description3": "Once issued, the license is valid for a specific period and must be renewed before expiration. Non-compliance with BIS norms can lead to suspension or cancellation of the BIS certificate."
    },
    "whyMatters": {
      "title": "Why Both ISI Mark and BIS license matters?",
      "description1": "While the ISI mark is what the consumer sees and trusts, the BIS license is the back-end approval that allows manufacturers to affix this mark legally. Without a valid BIS license, using the ISI mark constitutes a legal offense.",
      "description2": "This makes BIS registration not just a regulatory hurdle but a fundamental step in ensuring your products can be legally marketed and sold in India."
