# Fix for Dental Bib Napkins URL Issue

## Problem
The URL `https://bis-certifications.com/bis-qco-updates/bis-certificate-for-dental-bib-napkins` is showing a soft 404 because the production build doesn't have the latest URL generation fixes.

## Root Cause
The deployed build at `/root/sunconsultants/frontend/dist` is missing the updated `urlUtils.js` that handles forward slashes properly in notification titles.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Copy Latest Build to Production
```bash
# On your server, copy the latest built files
sudo cp -r /workspace/frontend/dist/* /root/sunconsultants/frontend/dist/

# Verify the files are updated
ls -la /root/sunconsultants/frontend/dist/assets/index*.js
```

### 2. Test the Fix
```bash
# Test the specific URL
curl -I "https://bis-certifications.com/bis-qco-updates/bis-certificate-for-dental-bib-napkins"

# Should return 200 OK with proper content
curl -s "https://bis-certifications.com/bis-qco-updates/bis-certificate-for-dental-bib-napkins" | grep -i "dental\|bib"
```

### 3. Verify Title Tag
The page should show:
```html
<title>BIS Notification for Dental bib/Napkins - BIS Certifications</title>
```

Instead of the generic:
```html
<title>BIS Certification | FMCS | ISI MARK | LMPC | EPR | CDSCO</title>
```

## Expected Result
After deployment, the URL will:
- ✅ Return 200 OK status
- ✅ Show correct notification title and content
- ✅ Display proper meta descriptions
- ✅ Be indexed correctly by Google

## Alternative (If Copy Fails)
If the copy command fails, rebuild directly in production:
```bash
cd /root/sunconsultants/frontend
npm run build
```

This will ensure the latest `urlUtils.js` fixes are included in the production build.
